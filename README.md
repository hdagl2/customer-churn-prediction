## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning and explainable AI to predict customer churn, understand the drivers behind churn, and communicate insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Goals

- Predict customer churn using logistic regression
- Use SHAP values for explainability
- Build an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders

## Tools Used

| Category      | Tools/Technologies                     |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Modeling      | Python (pandas, scikit-learn)          |
| Explainability| SHAP                                   |
| Dashboard     | Tableau Public                         |
| Hosting       | Tableau Public Link                    |

## Dashboard Features

- Churn rates by contract type
- Heatmap of churn risk by tenure and monthly charges
- Distribution of predicted churn probabilities
- KPI cards: total customers, churn %, avg tenure
- Filterable by contract type, senior citizen status, and more

## Business Insights

- **Month-to-month contracts** show the highest churn rate
- Customers with **low tenure** and **high monthly charges** are more likely to churn
- Retention efforts should focus on these segments
